The **Railway Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage train schedules and platform allocations efficiently. It allows users to add trains by providing their names and train numbers, allocate specific platforms if they are available, and deallocate platforms when necessary. Users can view all registered trains along with their assigned platforms, ensuring a clear overview of the railway schedule. Additionally, the system includes a feature to write train details to a file for record-keeping. This application helps in organizing train operations systematically, preventing platform conflicts and ensuring smooth railway management.
